# Unemployment-Rate-Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project is to utilize multiple datasets to learn important techniques in data science, and educate students on how to provide clear, presentable data. The final project will use datasets on the general US unemployment rate from 1948 to 2022 and more detailed percentages classified based on age, race, education level. Members will be taking a look at how various factors can affect the labor market, as well as discovering related social inequalities. Project members will decide how you will analyze the datasets, which features you want to research on, and how the social problems can potentially be solved. Members will ultimately create a final deliverable that summarizes the work that you've done, and interesting conclusions you have found over the course of a few weeks.
